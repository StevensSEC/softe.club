      # What is PyGame?
      - Wrapper for SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) Library
      - Access system's multimedia hardware (mouse, keyboard, joystick etc.)

      # Game Loop
      - Event Driven System
      ```python
      pygame.init()
      running = True
      while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
          if event.type == TARGET EVENT:
            DO ACTION
      pygame.quit()
      ```

      # Sprites
      - 2D representation of something on the screen
      - Player, Obstacles, Duck
  - content: |
      # Sprite Groups
      - Group of sprites
      - Why?
      - Helps manage all similar items together
  - content: |
      # Custom Events
      - Helps define new operations in the game
      ```python
      # Create a custom event for adding a new enemy
        ADDENEMY = pygame.USEREVENT + 1
        pygame.time.set_timer(ADDENEMY, 250)
      ```

      # Collision Detection
      - No need for complex geometric firmuale!
      ```python
        pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(player, enemies)
      ```
