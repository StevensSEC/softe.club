      This slide will be sticky.

      Normally, you need to know the slide index ahead of time;
      however, now you can specify a custom name via the `name` prop which
      can be used as a dynamic reference.

      This will be sticky until the slide with name `nail-polish-remover` is found.
    sticky: nail-polish-remover
  - type: default

      A slide does not need to contain a name. Names must be unique.

      *Names are available on slides programmatically through the `name` prop.*
  - type: default

      Names are only a QoL feature for people making slides. They are precomputed
      before rendering so that no duplicate names exist and if in the future, the
      need to return to a previous slide arises.

      An example might be to reference a presentation by slide with a URL.
      `softe.club/slides/learn-git#making-a-pr` for example.
  - type: default
    content: I am the NAIL POLISH REMOVER SLIDE. NO MORE STICKY.
    name: nail-polish-remover
  - type: default
    content: And that's how simple slide names are!
