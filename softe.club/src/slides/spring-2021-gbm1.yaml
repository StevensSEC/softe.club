      ## How to clone the repo

      1. Open a terminal
        - Powershell on Windows
      2. Navigate to the folder that you want to place the project into
        - *It'll automatically create a folder inside the current folder called `pokemonbattlelib`.*
      3. Run this command:

      ```bash
      gh repo clone StevensSEC/pokemonbattlelib
      ```
      4. Open it in VSCode
      ```bash
      cd pokemonbattlelib
      code .
      ```
      *Tip: Press tab to autocomplete.*

      # What's the goal?

      - Portable library that can be used to add Pokemon battles to anything
      - Users won't need to worry about accuracy or logic, just implement the frontend

      # What needs to be done?

      Currently, we basically don't have any code. We need something to start working with.

      As the project begins to take shape, we'll be able to add more issues.

      We'll also need people to create demo applications so we can test our API design!

      # To all the beginners

      We have a lot of beginners.

      - This is by far the BEST way to learn how to code.
        - You can take all the courses you want, but nothing is as good as actually coding for a project.
      - Getting stuck is OK, as long as you ask for help!
        - If we aren't in a GBM, ask your question in the `#i-need-help` channel on Slack.

      # Let's keep the ball rolling!

      - We have a lot of work to do, and only 11 GBMs to do it.
      - **Let's try our hardest to get everything in the "Core functionality" milestone DONE by Sunday, Feb 7.**
        - 3 issues, they block most other tasks
      - If we can close **ALL** the currently open issues by the next GBM, we will be making FANTASTIC pace.
      - Communication is key to steady progress!

      # How this works

      - Pick an issue to work on, or we can recommend one.
      - Make a new branch
      - Make your changes, commit them
      - Create a pull request
        - *Your code doesn't have to be perfect to make a pull request!*

      *This command will guide you through the process.*
      ```bash
      gh pr create
      ```
      - Automated tests will get run, and somebody else will review your code and give feedback.

      If you don't know what any of this means, *come to learnHack GO on this Saturday, Feb. 6 at 1pm*!
