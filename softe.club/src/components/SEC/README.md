# SEC's custom component library

This is where all of SEC's custom generic components live. These components exist so we can stop using the material-ui package. Maybe someday it could be moved to it's own repo, and we can publish our own npm package.

Rules for components that live in here:

-   No importing components from any parent directories.
-   No referencing assests in any parent directories.
-   No importing material-ui
