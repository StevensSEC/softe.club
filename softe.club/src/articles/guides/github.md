# GitHub: How do I use it?

GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories (aka. repo). Each repo has an issue tracker, projects (a kahnban board, similar to trello), and a wiki.

## Navigating

Repos have a bunch of tabs at the top for navigating around different parts of the repo. Below that is a list of files in the repo, followed by the contents of the repo's `README.md` file.

Above the tabs on the right, `Watch` subscribes you to notifications from the repo, `Star` is basically a like, and `Fork` creates a fork of the repo that you control. Right below the tabs, the dropdown on the left lets you browse code from different branches. The green `Code` button gives you the link to clone the repo. The part in blue right immediately above the file list shows the last commit, and how many commit's are in the git repo.

## Issues

Issues are how all repos keep track of bugs, and feature requests, as well as discuss aspects of the code and coordinate efforts.

Examples:

-   https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10546
-   https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/52855
-   https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/12429
-   https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/12092

When viewing an issue, the title and description are displayed in the center. Below it is discussion about the issue. You can assign users, add labels, etc. on the right side of the page.

## Pull Requests

A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge code from somebody else's branch into the main branch.

## Using GitHub for your own projects

After creating an account, you can create a new repo using the plus icon in the top right corner of the page.

You can then push code to this new repo.
