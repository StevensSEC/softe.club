# Bash Cheatsheet

## Paths

-   Paths that start with `/` are absolute paths, others are relative paths.
-   Files and folders that start with `.` are hidden be default
-   `./` refers to the current working directory. The `/` does not have to be included.
-   `..` refers to the parent of the working directory.
-   `~` refers to the directory `$HOME`

## Commands

-   `pwd` - print working directory <small style="opacity: 0.5">_(but you really shouldn't have to use this because the current working directory is usually displayed in your shell's prompt)_</small>
-   `ls` - list files
-   `ls -a` - list files, including hidden files
-   `cat FILE` - read `FILE`
-   `less FILE` - read `FILE`, but let me scroll (useful for reading large files)
-   `cd` - change directory to `$HOME`
-   `cd DIR` - change directory to `DIR`
-   `mv SOURCE TARGET` - move file from `SOURCE` to `TARGET`
-   `cp SOURCE TARGET` - copy file from `SOURCE` to `TARGET`
-   `rm FILE` - delete `FILE`
-   `mkdir DIR` - make a new directory called `DIR`
-   `grep PATTERN FILE` - search `FILE` for `PATTERN`, where `PATTERN` is a [regular expression](https://regexr.com)
