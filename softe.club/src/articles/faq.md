## How do I learn to code?

The best way to first learn how to code is with online tutorials or by taking an introductory course, such as E115/CS115. There are plenty of existing resources to teach the absolute basics. After that, the best way to learn new things is to start a project that uses those things. Do whatever you think is the coolest. Don't do big projects at first, because you are more likely to fail and get discouraged. It's important to remember that you will fail **a lot**, but don't let that discourage you.

We recommend you watch [How To Think Like A Programmer by Andy Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k).

## What language should I learn?

It doesn’t matter. Once you’ve learned one programming language, it’s pretty trivial to apply that knowledge to another language.

Programming languages are tools. Different languages are good at different things, so it's important to pick the right tool for the job. You don't want to use a hammer on a screw.

However, if you want recommendations for first languages, try something that doesn't let you do anything too strange and there are plenty of tutorials for:

-   Python
-   C#
-   Java

**Do not** use any of these as your first language:

-   C - Too complex for beginners beyond "Hello World"
-   C++ - Too complex for beginners beyond "Hello World"
-   Javascript - Lets you do weird and stupid things that are hard to understand for beginners, and ecosystem moves too fast for beginners to keep up
-   Rust - Too complex for beginners beyond "Hello World"
-   PHP - Weird syntax
-   Lua - Weird syntax

## How do I start a project?

The best projects are the ones that solve a problem that you have and another solution doesn't exist yet, but those are generally hard to stumble upon.

If you are having trouble coming up with a project to work on, copy something that already exists. You don't have to finish it, as long as you learn something from trying to copy it.
