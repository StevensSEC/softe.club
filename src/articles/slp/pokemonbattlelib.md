#### Spring 2021

pokemonbattlelib is a library for accurately simulating Pokèmon battles. It was intended to imported directly into a project (such as a game in-development), so that Pokèmon battle logic would be handled by our library. This was the club's first experience with the Go programming language. Writing in Go gave us experience with pointers and dereferencing, working inside a language that (technically) has no classes, and writing unit tests.
