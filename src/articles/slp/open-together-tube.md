### [OpenTogetherTube](https://github.com/dyc3/opentogethertube)

#### Fall 2019

OpenTogetherTube is a website that lets you watch videos with other people online. It's built with Node on the back end, and Vue on the front end. This project came in from a club member and continued to be maintained after its time as the SLP. It was inspired by the discontinuing of TogetherTube. Through it, the club engaged with concepts like websockets and unit testing with Jest.
