### [Stevens Web Extension](https://github.com/StevensSEC/stevens-web-extension)

#### Spring 2020

The Stevens Web Extension was meant to collect a bunch of useful tools for Stevens students. It would automate tasks that are tedious to do manually through official Stevens websites. This SLP was unique in that it was voted on by the general body. This project introduced members to Typescript and web scraping.
