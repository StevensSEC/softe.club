### [Quick Quack](https://github.com/StevensSEC/slp-1)

#### Spring 2019

SEC's first ever Semester Long Project, Quick Quack was a Yik Yak clone inspired by the discontinuing of Yik Yak. It's built with React on the front end and Node on the back end. Quick Quack was planned to be an app that allowed users (students around Stevens' campus) to post messages anonymously to a board other users could then view. The catch would be that the posts are limited to the region they were made in (around campus).
