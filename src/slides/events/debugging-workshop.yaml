      # What you'll need
      - Bare minimum programming knowledge
      - Visual Studio Code
        - [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
        - *This is different from Visual Studio!*
      - Visual Studio
        - Only if you are on Windows
        - Only if you care about following along with the C++ example

      # What is a debugger?
      - Pauses execution at breakpoints
      - Lets you step line by line
      - Lets you inspect memory in the middle of execution

      # How do you use a debugger?
      We'll be using VSCode as a front end for the debugger.

      Copy this code into a new `.py` file.
      ```python
      for i in range(100):
        if i % 15 == 0:
          print("fizzbuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
          print("fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
          print("buzz")
        else:
          print(i)
      ```

      # How do you use a debugger?
      Here's a C++ example

      *If you are on windows, you are going to want to use Visual Studio.*

      Copy this code into a new `.cpp` file.
      ```cplusplus
      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;

      int main() {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
          cout << i << endl;
        }
      }
      ```

      # But why?
      ## Here are some actually useful examples

      - mini-assembly-interpreter
      - code a-la mode bot
  - content: |
      # That's all there is to it.
      Using breakpoints to debug is
      - easy
      - clean
      - fast
      - more useful the more complex a bug is

      Now you know how to use it to your advantage.
